This 05-challenge- scheduler is an introduction to thirdparty appilcations such as jquery. Students deploy a web page that is responsible for generating
a color coded event planner for the current day that saves user input and reloads upon page refresh.


## User Story

SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule

THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
